I made my first website in 2022, and it was barebones. You can visit the original [repo](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/website) for my website to see just how minimal it was. This was back before I even knew what a JavaScript framework was, and most definitely before I knew almost anything about web develpoment.

# How I Made It

The website was made quite quickly with heavy inspriation from the websites [based.cooking](https://based.cooking) and Tom Marks' personal website [Tom Marks Talks Code](https://coding.tommarks.xyz/index.html). Written using just HTML and CSS with a tiny amount of elementary JavaScript used to get animations and link copying working, it was minimal enough - and got the job done.

I was quite proud of hosting it myself, though - I followed Luke Smith's tutorial on setting up a website using Vultr and Nginx, and it worked quite well. I snagged my domain name from Google Domains and quickly set up the email server and website. The email server turned out to be one of the most useful tools I could have had from this entire experience. With this server, I make as many accounts as I need for various purposes (spam@charliemeyer.xyz, for example), send emails from my website, and, most importantly, use it as one of my primary emails. The reality of this project was that the website was merely an afterthought - I styled it incredibly quickly and then moved on.

# Upon Refelection

Despite all I've said about the website previously, I think that this was a crucial step towards my development as a coder, as it helped spark my desire to make websites/apps (such as this one!). It'll be great to look back on the variations of my personal website as I grow in skills, tastes, and interests. And if i get around to it, I think i'll host all versions of my website on the domain, so you could go to <BackTicks>v0.charliemeyer.xyz</BackTicks> to see the first version of my website and so on.
