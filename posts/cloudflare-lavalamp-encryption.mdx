I came across [this](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/) incredibly obscure article about how Cloudflare uses the consistent randomness of lava lamps to generate
encryption keys. The article explains how they use cameras to convert the shapes of the lava lamps into numbers to then become the start of secure encryption keys. 

But, these lamps are mostly just for show. Cloudflare has 3 major offices with unique encryption mechanisms in place. 
Their London office takes photos of a double-pendulum system - these movements are unpredictable and are used in their 
encryption just like these lava lamps. Their Singapore office measures the radioactive decay of a pellet of 
uranium (a small harmless amount) for their encryption purposes. All of these are fairly unnecessary especially when 
you take into consideration how in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted 
sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
