After stumbling across [chronark.com](https://chronark.com) (and admiring how damn beautiful it is), 
I realized Andreas' blog had something mine doesn't - a view counter. Luckily, the tool he's building, 
[upstash](https://upstash.com/), has an easy-to-use package & tutorial to use their Redis
service to add a view counter to your blog. But why do that? As a certified AWS lover ðŸ«¶, I couldn't just 
copy and paste mindlessly. I had to do it myself.

## Pre-Code Design Decisions

**DynamoDB** - While never having used Dynamo before, I knew it would be a quick and easy way to store unstructured data, 
and bascially just _dump some json_ into a table. The configuration for Dynamo was smooth, barring warnings reminding me to shift to the 
[AWS SDK for JS (v3)](https://a.co/7PzMCcy), which, admittely, would have made the coding experience significantly
better. I also was consistently reminded that AWS doesn't want you to directly interface with Dynamo and generate keys for a Dynamo 
role, as they _really_ try to get you to use Lambda/API Gateway to access Dynamo. Yes, this is absolute best practice, but not necessary 
for a simple view counter.

**What is a view?** - Before actually implementing a view counter, I had to decide what constitutes a view. Facebook 
counts a view as at least 3 seconds of a video fully on screen. Although I would love to be flattered by an absurdly high view count, 
I determined that a view would be a visit from a unique IP address at least 5 minutes apart. This way, I'd avoid "spam refreshing" 
(although I appreciate your enthusiasm to increase my view count!).

**Is this safe?** - The [upstash tutorial](https://upstash.com/blog/nextjs13-approuter-view-counter) makes sure that you are not directly storing 
IP addresses in Dynamo by hashing using a simple function: 
```js
const ip = req.ip;
// Hash the IP and turn it into a hex string
const buf = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", new TextEncoder().encode(ip));
const hash = Array.from(new Uint8Array(buf))
.map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
.join("");
```
I did the same, and stored the hashed IP address in Dynamo.

**Dynamo Structure** - With the definition of a view in mind, I made the decision to set my sort key as `slug` and 
structure each slug's data like:
```json
    {
    "slug": {
        "S": "todays-xkcd" // the slug of the post
    },
    "ips": {
        "L": [ // a list of objects, each with an IP and a visit date
            {
                "M": {
                    "ip": {
                        "S": "eff8e..." // an abridged version of a hashed IP
                    },
                    "visitDate": {
                        "N": "1698694949752" // some time in UTC
                    }
                }
            },
        ]
    }
    }
```

## Implementation 

With the design decisions made, I leveraged NextJs' built in API routes coupled with abstraction using hooks
to create a clean, easy-to-use view counter. To do this, I knew I needed to implement a few key features:

**A `useViews()` hook** - This entire hook only took _30 lines of code_. With a useable interface
of `const { views, numViews, ip, updateItem } = useViews(slug)`, I abstracted away the complexity of 
interfacing with Dynamo and the API routes. Through this, each post & the post list merely needed to 
get `numViews` for its slug, and the view counter was done. Just look at how clean, readable, and understandable this is!
```js
const useViews = (slug) => {
  const [views, setViews] = useState([]);
  const [numViews, setNumViews] = useState(" - ");
  const [ip, setIp] = useState("");
  const [shouldRefetch, setShouldRefetch] = useState(false);

  const fetchViews = async () => {
    const res = await axios.post("/api/dynamo/getViews", { slug: slug });
    const data = res.data;
    setViews(data.views);
    setNumViews(data.numViews);
    setIp(data.ip);
  };
  
  const updateItem = async (slug) => {
    await axios.post("/api/dynamo/updateItem", { slug: slug });
    setShouldRefetch((prevState) => !prevState);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchViews();
  }, [slug, shouldRefetch]);

  return { views, numViews, ip, updateItem };
};
```

**A route to `getViews`** - This route is called by the `useViews` hook, and returns the number of views.
Furthermore, if an item in Dynamo does not exist for this slug, it creates that item. This way, creating new
posts (like this one!) does not require me to run some script to create a Dynamo entry for each post. Crucially, this 
route just uses this simple query to get the object associated with a slug:
```js
const params = {
    TableName: process.env.DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME,
    Key: {
        slug: { S: slug },
    },
};

const data = await dynamodb.getItem(params).promise();

const ipsData = data.Item.ips.L.map((entry) => ({
    ip: entry.M.ip.S,
    visitDate: parseInt(entry.M.visitDate.N, 10),
}));

res.status(200).json({
    views: ipsData,
    numViews: ipsData.length,
});
```

**A route to `incrementViews`** - similar to `getViews`, incrementing views leverage's Dynamo's `updateItem` with a 
set of params: 
```js
const updateParams = {
    TableName: process.env.DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME,
    Key: {
        slug: { S: slug },
    },
    UpdateExpression:
        "SET ips = list_append(if_not_exists(ips, :empty_list), :new_view)",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ":empty_list": { L: [newView] }, // make a new one if it doesn't exist
        ":new_view": { L: [newView] },
    },
};
const res = await dynamodb.updateItem(updateParams).promise();
// calling, parsing, and returning the response
```

## Conclusion

Since the code for this entire website is publically available [on my GitHub](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/website2), 
this isn't necessarily meant to be a comphrehensive walkthrough, but a discussion that touches on 
ideas of abstraction, design decisions, and leveraging AWS while also going through the process of implementing
some of the core methods that make up my view counter.

This feature of my blog was aimed at implementing various code-quality best-practice ideas in a concrete manner, 
more of a manner of practicing than anything else.
