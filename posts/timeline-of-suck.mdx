Delayed gratification is the most infuriating thing, especially when it comes to _"fun"_ things. You know when video games were suppsoed to be fun, 
and then all of a sudden you're playing against ranked players who maul you? Learning guitar to pass time? Oh yeah, that's great fun, 
have fun learning barre chords, music theory, and all that other stuff. Learning to code? Just make sure you've read the 
entirety of the "C Programming Language" front to back, upside down, and backwards before you even think about writing a <BackTicks>Hello world</BackTicks>.
Point is, there's a **lot** of suck at a lot of fun things before you get to the fun part. 

I think it's hilarious to think of it as a timeline of suck - get through the worst part, the grass is greener a couple years down the line. 
That keeps me going, and it's pretty funny, too. Speaking of which, my barre chords suck - I need to practice. Like Jack Johnson 
said 2 minutes into [this video](https://youtu.be/71klkVpBRS4), "you can do anything you want to do if you keep practicing."

Anyways -  keep pushing the rock, Sisyphus. It'll be a pebble one day.
