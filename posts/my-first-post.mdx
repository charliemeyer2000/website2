```js
export default function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello world</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Hello world. This is my first blog post using Nextjs and mdx to create a blog. This makes it very easy for me (or anyone for that matter) to create a blog post, all you've gotta do is just create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file and add some stuff, create a pull request and **bam!** you've got yourself a blog post.

Also, with Vercel making deployment super easy, it should re-deploy every time a new pull request is merged into the `main` branch. So, if you're reading this, it means that it worked! Yay!
