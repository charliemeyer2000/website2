This document tests adding LaTeX to my MDX documents. $\forall_x \in \mathbb{N}, \text{there exists a } y \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } x < y$.

$\int_0^1 x^2 dx$

Ok wow! I think this works great. However, I can't do centered equations as you usually can with double dollar signs. I'll have to look into that.
Maybe i'll just make a "Centered" component that achieves this instead. Oh well :shrug:

This is also an image test that auto centers. ![test image](/static/images/gwa-gwa-cat.png) This is just the default image using the `! [alt tag] (/path/to/image)` syntax,
but i could also make a custom image component to do more fancy things if I want too. But for now, this is fine. Thanks `rehype-images`!

This is a test of the `rehype-katex` plugin. It seems to work pretty well. I can do inline math like this: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ and it works great. This could be
helpful in the future if I want to do math or other things in a blog post other than just text/code.
