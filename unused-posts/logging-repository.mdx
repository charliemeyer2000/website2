As I've started to learn more about AWS through taking a course on Certified Solutions
Architect, I've learned a lot more about easy and cheap ways to execute arbitrary code
in the cloud for whatever purpose. Thus came about the idea of my logging-repository -
a repository [live on my GitHub](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/logging-repository)
that listens to pushes to any repository with the webhook configured and summarizes/offers
full details of the commit and updates the repository.

# Attempt 0 - Baby Steps

I first accomplished this task locally hosting a flask server that I sent a dummy
JSON payload to that resembled a JSON payload of a push event. With this, I made a quick script
that would summarize the commit and push it to the repository. The main function at `/webhook`
takes in two arguments, `request` and `response` - `request` is the payload from the webhook,
and `response` is the response that the server will send back to the webhook.
You can see the code of the entire function on GitHub, but here's a pseudocode outline:

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def main(request, response):
    # Get the payload from the event, which I specified would be in JSON
    payload = request.get_json()

    # Get the commit message & sha
    commit_message = payload['head_commit']['message']
    commit_sha = payload['head_commit']['id']

    # Make a call to the GitHub API to get the full commit details
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repository_committed_to}/commits/{commit_sha}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"
    }

    # Request and process the data from the API
    response = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()

    # Do some processing on the data
    ...

    # Generate a summary of the commit with OpenAI API
    commit_summary = generate_summary(code_added=lines_added, code_removed=lines_removed, commit_message=commit_message)

    # Create a commit
    create_commit(...params)

    return 'Success'
```

The anonymous function `create_commit` creates a commit using the GitHub API,
with a GPT summary and the entire commit, editing the
`logs.md` file with the new commit.

Ok, cool! But this worked on JSON dummy data - how do I get this to work with GitHub's webhook?

# Attempt 1 - Ngrok

I first tried to use ngrok to expose my local server to the internet. I ran the flask server locally, and then
pointed my ngrok instance to the port that the server was running on. Great! Point the webhook to that URL
in the 'webhooks' tab of the repository settings, and it should work!

And it did! Until I turned off my computer, ngrok stopped running, and the webhook was no longer valid. So the obvious problem
was that I needed it to be running 24/7.

# Attempt 2 - Lightsail

My immediate thought to solve the ngrok problem was to use AWS Lightsail to quickly spin up a a server that would run the
flask server. And, well it did work! And this was great, until i navigated to the billing tab of my AWS Console. Lightsail
is exactly what it says it is - a quick way to spin up a server. But it's not cheap. I was paying ~$3.50 a month for a server
that was probably being used 5-10 times a day for commits, so there was a lot of wasted money having a server up 24/7 when it
simply did not have to be.

# Attempt 3 - AWS Lambda & API Gateway

I only really came to the conclusion that Lambda was absolutely **goated** when I was taking the AWS Certified Solutions Architect,
and it was like I was hit over the head. This was literally the perfect use for my logging-repository - run arbitrary code in the cloud once when
a webhook is triggered, and only be charged for _just the time that the code is running_. So, i modified my flask server to be a lambda function:

```Python

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    payload = json.loads(event['body'])

    # same code
    ...

    create_commit(...params)
    return 'Success'
```

Then, with a little bit of fanagling with API Gateway, I had this function running on POST at `api.charliemeyer.xyz/logging-repository`.
I then pointed the webhook to this URL, and it worked! You can also navigate to [api.charliemeyer.xyz/test](https://api.charliemeyer.xyz/test) to see lambda working in action just returning
`Hello from Lambda!`.

# Attempt 4 - The Future

Right now the endpoint for the webhook is unsecured, so in theory anyone could have their commits logged to my repository. I'm not really worried about that Unless
someone incredibly malicious sends billions of requests and I get charged a lot of money, but I'm not too worried about that. GitHub and AWS has a security option to verify
the sender that I'll implement soon.
