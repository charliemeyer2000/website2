I've always been a cynic when it comes to goals. I did (and sometimes still do) chuckle when I see people writing their goals
on a whiteboard (a la [Gifted Hater](https://youtu.be/h_KpLPHbVew) around 7:44). Especially with social media influencing and
people marketing and capitalizing on literally "selling goals" to people or "selling motivation", I've become more and more
cynical. I mean, it's almost comical seeing these influencers attempt to sell this - one of my favorites being this **hilarious**
[Gary Vee clip](https://youtube.com/shorts/yiSfYDLqWq0?feature=share). I think we've become so overly saturated by this type of
content that it's pushed me against even the concept of goal setting. The setup of this writing makes it seem that I'm going to
be doing an incredible 180 and start acting like I've now found the secret to motivation and start selling you my course for $19.99/month,
but realistically, I just wanted to talk about what works for me, and also what fucking flopped.

# Writing It Down

I'll spare the details, but recently I was told that I say I'm going to do things and then never follow through with them. I said
I wanted to learn more about machine learning, and that fire died quite quickly when my work began. I wanted to work on my startup
all summer - well that work for about half of it, but I got demotivated (although I'm hyped to get back on it this fall). These are
small examples and might not have been what that person was referencing when they told me about this personality trait, but I
do think that there's reason to why. It's incredibly diffuclt to remember all the things going on. I mean, each and every day we've got to
wake up, make our bed, drink enough water, eat three meals, complete _insert work_, take time for ourselves, spend time with friends,
be with our family... adding something into a routine or entirely bucking your routine is definitely not easy. For me, all it took to
add something I wanted to do was to just write it down and remind myself of it. I've probably downloaded like 5 different schedule manager applications
or other tools that are supposed to boost productivity and be all-in-one solutions, but (shocker) I found the easiest thing was
to write it physically and have your handwriting staring at you. I just have a scrap piece of paper taped to my desk with a list of things
I want to accomplish relatively soon. Maybe my tastes or desires change, but I think something about the physical act makes it feel real.

# Motivation

As I mentioned previously, I think that social media has made motivation a product. Everyone is selling self-help books or
doing these weirdly over-saturated (literally) videos of people just going incredibly hard 24/7. I find that "extreme" or "hardcode"
approach is right, you'll just get tired in a week and give up. Casey Neistat had a great quote from the start of [this video](https://youtu.be/96xCMOu3RJs)
that encapsulates the way that I think about motivation - "I'm here, all of my dreams and aspirations are (over here), and the only
thing between these two are a bunch of work". Full circle moment incomng - without a goalpost, you can't score. You need goals to
work towards (a la Locke and Latham's [goal setting theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting#Goal_setting_theory)). So,
however you establish those goals, even if it's the corny whiteboard, they set you up for opportunity.

# Who Gives?

I think it's so easy to take a "we live on a floating rock" approach to life and say goals are not necessary, and to
live entirely on a whim. I agree, and I do love that attitude every so often. Sporadicness and doing things on a whim does bring
a lot of joy and excitement to life, but I'd argue it's not sustainable. I do want to do a spur-of-the-moment trip with my buddies
relatively soon, but I can't do that every day. I think that's where goals come in. They're a way to keep you on track and
giving you "swimming" lanes. Sure, go over the lanes every so often, but as long as you get back into the lane, you're fine.
