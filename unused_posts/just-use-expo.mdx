After building and shipping an MVP for my first phone application [DoorShop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/doorshop/id6496682406), I want to discuss the process and importance of picking a tech stack.

This photo above from a fantastic [article](https://medium.com/alan/our-journey-from-react-native-to-expo-for-mobile-app-development-at-alan-%EF%B8%8F-3b1569e8ab7c) by the Alan team highlights why Expo is just the best.

# Everything Else Sucks

Allow me to explain why you should use Expo by showing you why everything else sucks.

1. **SwiftUI & Xcode** - Want to develop for only the App Store which charges $100/year to publish on the App Store and takes 33% of your in-app purchases? Want to constantly
   fight Xcode crashing and horrible documentation? Want to have little developer or community support with fundamental packages and UI toolling? Perfect! Use SwiftUI.
1. **React Native** - want to overcomplicate your project with custom toolchains for compilation and native modules? Want a slow development cycle with unsupported
   packages and painful debugging? React Native is for you!
1. **Flutter** - ????
1. **Java & Kotlin** - `public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("no."); }`

# The Trader Joes of App Dev

I think of Expo like Next for the phone - its a framework that is _just so good_ that you actively want to give them your money. I mean they make it _painfully easy_
to do things like notifications, building, CI, deployment, and publication to the app store with EAS Build.

Moreover, Expo supports tons of open-source packages to interface with native modules - camera, barcode scanning, maps, photos, and more. Plus, you can easily manage
all the configuration that comes with building for iOS and Android in one place with their `eas.json` file - no more `info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml` hell.
As an engineer, I often fall victim to over-engineering solutions with a tech stack that is incredibly complex but not necessary. Expo leans you in to
just doing the simplest thing that works and shipping it. Sure, it can be impressive to write your own CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipelines and Lambda functions, but
why not just use Expo's EAS Build and save yourself the headache? Why try to tool your own notifications system when Expo handles this for you? Just like Vercel,
Expo makes it easy to deploy and manage your app with their CLI and web dashboard that you almost can't say no.
